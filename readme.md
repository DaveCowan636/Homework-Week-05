Homework-Week-5

I had a hard time getting my code work from Atom to GitHub this week. Not sure why, I started by creating a subfolder under my mart341 folder named homework-week-05. Then I opened Atom and started inputting code, the examples in the homework this week helped a lot with the coding. I did a little google searching for a code sequence to add background color. After doing this my images were showing with a white background around them instead of just sitting on top of the background image, issue seemed to be they were a .jpeg file. I found some other options to use in clip art and was able to use them without a problem. I was having a problem getting my input box's for Name/ Age/ Email/ Zip to line up together, tried spacing them out, could get them close but not perfectly lined up. Ended up adding a break after each label in order to drop them underneath. Think it brought the look together but would have liked to of had them to the side instead.

Have had to create another repository after only being able to display my read me text on the
the web site.  Hopefully I did something wrong when I created the file and redoing this
process will work.

It also seems to take like 25-30 minuets for GitHub to have the changes I committed show up
under my repository. Should it be taking that long? I have tried closing my browser and
reloading the Github page to see if it shows up faster.
